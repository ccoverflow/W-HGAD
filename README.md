# W-HGAD
Official implementation of W-HGAD: a Wasserstein-based heterogeneous graph neural network for uncertainty-aware anomaly detection on graphs.


## Coming Soon

We are currently in the process of organizing and preparing our codebase and datasets for public release. The full implementation of W-HGAD, along with the datasets used in our experiments, will be made available in this repository soon.

Stay tuned for updates! We appreciate your interest and patience.

[Watch this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/be-social#watching-a-repository) to be notified when we publish our code and data.
